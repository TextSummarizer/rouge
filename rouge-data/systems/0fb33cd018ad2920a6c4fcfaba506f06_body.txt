Scotland exceeded its renewable energy target, set in 2007, for 31% of total power generation coming from renewables by 2011, and the 2020 target for the renewable share of total electricity generation has been raised from 50% to 100%. Of this, only 20% was consumed in the form of electricity by end users, the great majority of energy utilised being from the burning of oil (41%) and gas (36%). With 20 GW of renewable energy projects in the pipeline, the sector has the potential to grow quickly in the years ahead creating more jobs in the region. In 2005 the aim was for 18% of Scotland's electricity production to be generated by renewable sources by 2010, rising to 40% by 2020. It is estimated that as much as another 1.2 GW of capacity remains available to exploit, mostly in the form of micro and small-hydro developments such as the existing one in Knoydart and a system planned for Kingussie. The 100 MW Glendoe Project which opened in 2009 was the first large scale scheme in Scotland for almost fifty years but is likely to be one of the last of its kind. Most turbines in the EU produce electricity at an average of 25% of their rated maximum power due to the intermittency of wind resources, but Scotland's wind regime provides average of 40% or higher on the west and northern coasts. However a 2011 Forestry Commission and Scottish government follow-up report concluded that: "...there is no capacity to support further large scale electricity generation biomass plants from the domestic wood fibre resource." A plan to build in Edinburgh a 200MW biomass plant which would have imported 83% of its wood, was withdrawn by Forth Energy in 2012. A related issue is the planned high-voltage Beaulyâ€“Denny power line which will bring electricity from renewable projects in the north and west to the cities of the south. The potential for such a scheme has been described as includin
