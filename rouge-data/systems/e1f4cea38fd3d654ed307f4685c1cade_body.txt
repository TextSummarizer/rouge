The brightness continues to increase in the direction of Jupiter and has a maximum near the ring’s center at 126 000 km, although there is a pronounced gap (notch) near the orbit of Metis at 128 000 km. The inner boundary of the main ring, in contrast, appears to fade off slowly from 124 000 to 120 000 km, merging into the halo ring. One of the discoveries of the Galileo orbiter was the bloom of the main ring—a faint, relatively thick (about 600 km) cloud of material which surrounds its inner part. This parent body population is confined to the narrow—about 1000 km—and bright outer part of the main ring, and includes Metis and Adrastea. The formation of the larger set of waves can be explained if the ring was impacted by a cloud of particles released by the comet with a total mass on the order of 2–5 x 1012 kg, which would have tilted the ring out of the equatorial plane by 2 km. The true vertical extent of the halo is not known but the presence of its material was detected as high as 10 000 km over the ring plane. Thus the width of the halo ring is about 30 000 km. The bloom of the main ring may be a beginning of the halo. Being derived from the main ring, the halo has the same age. The detection of the Amalthea gossamer ring from the ground, in Galileo images and the direct dust measurements have allowed the determination of the particle size distribution, which appears to follow the same power law as the dust in the main ring with q=2 ± 0.5. The thickness of the ring is approximately 8400 km near the orbit of Thebe and slightly decreases in the direction of the planet.[f] The Thebe gossamer ring is brightest near its top and bottom edges and gradually becomes brighter towards Jupiter—much like the Amalthea ring. The optical depth of the Thebe gossamer ring is about 3 × 10−8, which is three times lower than the Amalthea gossamer ring, but the total mass of the dust is the same—about 107–109 kg. The dust in the gossam
