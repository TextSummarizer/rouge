What is now recognized as a single morphologically variable taxon named Galerina marginata was once split into five distinct species. The oldest of these names are Agaricus marginatus, described by August Batsch in 1789, and Agaricus unicolor, described by Martin Vahl in 1792. Agaricus autumnalis was described by Charles Horton Peck in 1873, and later moved to Galerina by A. Another of the synonymous species, G. Galerina venenata was first identified as a species by Smith in 1953. pseudomycenopsis as a distinct species. marginata is the type species of Galerina section Naucoriopsis, a subdivision first defined by French mycologist Robert KÃ¼hner in 1935. oregonensis are in stirps Autumnalis, while G. venenata are in stirps Marginata. Common names of the species include the "marginate Pholiota" (resulting from its synonymy with Pholiota marginata), "funeral bell", "deadly skullcap", and "deadly Galerina". autumnalis was known as the "fall Galerina" or the "autumnal Galerina", while G. Galerina marginata may be mistaken for a few edible mushroom species. marginata may be easily confused with other edibles such as Armillaria mellea and Kuehneromyces mutabilis. marginata bears an astonishing resemblance to this fungus, and it requires careful and acute powers of observation to distinguish the poisonous one from the edible one." K. vernalis is a rare species and even more similar in appearance to G. A rough resemblance has also been noted with the edible Hypholoma capnoides, as well as Conocybe filaris, another poisonous amatoxin-containing species. The toxins found in Galerina marginata are known as amatoxins. marginata is thought to be the only species of the amatoxin-producing genera that will produce the toxins while growing in culture. In this study, the amanitin amounts from certain Galerina specimens were
