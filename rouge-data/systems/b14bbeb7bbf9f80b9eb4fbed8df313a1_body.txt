It is one of 12 species of the genus Malurus, commonly known as fairywrens, found in Australia and lowland New Guinea. Within the genus it belongs to a group of four very similar species known collectively as Chestnut-shouldered Fairywrens. The other three species are the Lovely Fairywren (M. lamberti) found across most of the continent, and the Blue-breasted Fairywren (M. Molecular study showed the Blue-breasted Fairywren to be the most closely related to the Red-winged Fairywren. Like other fairywrens, the Red-winged Fairywren is unrelated to the true wrens. Southwestern birds gave rise to what is now the Red-winged Fairywren, while those in the northwest of the continent became the Variegated Fairywren. Survival of fairywrens from one season to the next is generally high for such small birds, and the Red-winged Fairywren has the highest rate of allâ€”with 78% of breeding males and 77% of breeding females surviving from year to year. It borders the range of the Variegated Fairywren on the northern limit of its range, and the Blue-breasted Fairywren in the eastern limit, with the latter two species occupying dryer scrub while the Red-winged Fairywren is restricted to wetter forests. The Red-winged Fairywren is a cooperative breeding species, with a pair or small group of birds maintaining and defending a territory year-round. Female helpers are much more common in this species than the other species intensively studied, the Superb Fairywren (M. Like other species of fairy wrens, Red-winged Fairywrens may use a 'Rodent-run' display to distract predators from nests with young birds. Like all fairywrens, the Red-winged Fairywren is an active and restless feeder, foraging in bracken (Pteridium esculentum) and low shrubs, as well as in leaf-litter on the ground near shelter. Like other fairywrens, male Red-winged Fairywrens have been observed carrying brightly coloured petals to display to females as part
